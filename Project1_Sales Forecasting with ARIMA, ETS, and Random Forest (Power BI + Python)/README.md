# Sales Forecasting with ARIMA, ETS, and Random Forest

A full-stack data science project that demonstrates advanced time series forecasting using classical models (ARIMA, ETS) and machine learning (Random Forest), along with a professional Power BI dashboard.

## 📊 Business Problem

Retail businesses struggle with accurately forecasting product demand across locations and time. This project forecasts **daily sales** using time series data from Ecuadorian stores.

Accurate forecasting helps in:
- Inventory management
- Promotions & planning
- Operational cost reduction

---

## 📁 Dataset Overview

This project uses historical sales data enriched with:
- 🛢️ Oil prices (`oil.csv`)
- 🏖️ Holiday events (`holidays_events.csv`)
- 🏬 Store information (`stores.csv`)
- 🧾 Transactions (`transactions.csv`)

---

## 🔍 Methodology

### 1. Data Enrichment
Combined multiple datasets into one feature-rich training set.

### 2. Feature Engineering
Created features like:
- `year`, `month`, `dayofweek`, `is_weekend`
- Aggregations on transactions and oil prices

### 3. Forecasting Models
- **ARIMA** (Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average)
- **ETS** (Exponential Smoothing)
- **Random Forest** Regressor

### 4. Model Evaluation (RMSE)

| Model          | RMSE (Lower is better) |
|----------------|------------------------|
| ARIMA          | 107,251.00             |
| ETS            | 161,663.76             |
| Random Forest  | **264.01** ✅ Best     |

## 📈 Power BI Dashboard

Interactive 5-page dashboard designed for business stakeholders:

1. **Overview & KPIs** — Sales, stores, product families  
2. **Data Exploration** — Sales by store, family, trends  
3. **ARIMA/ETS Forecast** — Visual + RMSE comparison  
4. **RF Forecast** — Actual vs Predicted, Feature Importance  
5. **Final Insights** — Recommendations for the business
